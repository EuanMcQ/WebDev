Project Overview:

	Movie Guru is a website where users can sign up, log in, delete their accounts, and create their own movie library. The site features four categories of movies: Oscar Winners, Rotten Tomatoes Highest Rated, Recommended, and Box 	Office Flops. Users can add movies from these categories to their personal library. Additionally, there is a page dedicated to decorated directors.

	The back-end of the website is built using Node.js, with a server that communicates with a MySQL database. The database model is provided in the included database dump file.

Running The Server:
